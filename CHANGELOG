1/23/24 - Created Repository

1/25/24 - Ross practiced creating ML models with data built into R. These went into the "Practicing" folder
          - kNN model
          - Linear Model with and without Cross-validation
          
1/29/2024 - Ross practed creating more ML models with data built into R. These also went into the "Practicing" folder
          - Confusion Matrix verification for generalized linear regression
          - Random Forest
          - ROC Curve with a generlized linear regression
          - Model selection using a common set of training data with holes
              - GLM
              - RF
              - kNN
              
1/30/2024 - Ross continuted practice with model selection
              - Support Vector Machine Model
              - Naive Bayes
          - Once models were complete, they were compared graphically and the best was used on the test data
          
2/2/2024  - Olivia entered the chat :))    
          - Uploaded ANSYS-FLUENT code
              - computational fluid dynamics for modeling fluid in complex geometries
          
2/05/2024 - Imported "Data" folder based on Transcribed materials from files '4 Distribution-disinfection of bacterial loads WR 2012.pdf', '5 P adsorption-desorption WM910 Chapter 4.pdf', and '6 Prototype testing of P fate WM910 Chapter 5.pdf'
