1/23/24 - Created Repository

1/25/24 - Ross practiced creating ML models with data built into R. These went into the "Practicing" folder
          - kNN model
          - Linear Model with and without Cross-validation
          
1/29/2024 - Ross practed creating more ML models with data built into R. These also went into the "Practicing" folder
          - Confusion Matrix verification for generalized linear regression
          - Random Forest
          - ROC Curve with a generlized linear regression
          - Model selection using a common set of training data with holes
              - GLM
              - RF
              - kNN
              
1/30/2024 - Ross continuted practice with model selection
              - Support Vector Machine Model
              - Naive Bayes
          - Once models were complete, they were compared graphically and the best was used on the test data
